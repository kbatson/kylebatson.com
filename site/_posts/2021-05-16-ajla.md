<p>The majority of my time at America's Job Link Alliance was to help with a project to port their existing flagship application to a new code base. They wanted to take the refactor as an opportunity to improve the user interface of the application. Unfortunately, because this was largely a straight port of the old code, there was little opportunity to rethink fundamentals of the user experience before it launched.</p>

<p>However, I was able to drive research of existing users to help better understand our users and how they interact with the system. This resulted in improvements to the user experience as well as informed the development of personas to help guide future feature development. I also used this data as well as heuristic analysis of current features to develop workflows and requirements to build a comprehensive roadmap for a user-centered product development going forward.</p>

<p>I was able to utilize my extensive experience in standards-based HTML and accessibility to help make the flagship application Section 508 compliant by adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.</p>
