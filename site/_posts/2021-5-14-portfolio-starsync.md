<p>This was a small project undertaken for a startup that was creating its own line of astrophotography star trackers. There was a complex sequence of events that needed to occur to get the system set up and calibrated. This workflow was designed to help make that process intuitive and error-free. The prototype was built using Sketch.</p>
