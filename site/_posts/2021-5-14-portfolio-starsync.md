<p>This was a small project undertaken for a startup that was creating its own line of astrophotography star trackers. There was a complex sequence of events that needed to occur to get the system set up and calibrated. This workflow was designed to help make that process intuitive and error-free. The prototype was built using Sketch.</p>

I sat down with the product owner and talked through their existing system, and asked about the context of how the product was used. I gathered information on who their users were and how they would primarily use the product. I built a low-fidelity prototype, walked the product owner through it, and incorporated their feedback into the higher-fidelity prototype shown here.
