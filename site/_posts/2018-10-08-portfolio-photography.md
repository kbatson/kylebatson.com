			<p>Photography is a huge passion of mine. I enjoy traveling and taking photos candidly of strangers all around the world. I have also used my photography skills in more formal settings such as architectural interiors, portraits and other studio work. I have included a small number of samples here, but you can see more of my work at my photography website <a href="http://www.kylebatsonphoto.com/">www.kylebatsonphoto.com</a>.</p>
