<p>I designed and built this website for the talented painter, Susan Grace. It was built on top of an ExpressionEngine back-end giving the artist the ability to easily update her own portfolio.</p>
<p>I also provided branding and designed print collateral for use in her shows, as well as shot photographs to archive her work.</p>
