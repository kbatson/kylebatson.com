<p>Hello, I am a UX/UI designer working to improve the experience of products and services and making a positive impact on the lives of those my designs impact. I take a holistic approach to understanding how systems work at a high-level, but also have extensive experience of getting down into the smallest details of interactions that work together to delight users.</p>
<p>I am passionate about the quality of the products I work on and advocate for the needs of the user in every stage of product development. I have extensive experience in front-end development and accessibility and I am a strong advocate for user-centered design at an organizational level. I have also led software engineering teams so I am proficient at communicating about the design process, and generating empathy towards users.</p>
