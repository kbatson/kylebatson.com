	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<div class="sectionContent">
		<p><img src="/assets/images/profile-photo.jpeg" alt="Profile photo" id="profilePhoto" class="alignRight">Hello. My name is Kyle and I'm passionate about design and photography. I enjoy learning and understanding how large systems work, but I also sweat the details to help create the best products I can. I pride myself in putting myself in the shoes of the user and imagining different scenarios to produce the best design for the widest user-base.</p>
		<p>Design has been a focus of mine since childhood. I have been designing and building websites since I was 14. I taught myself HTML and CSS by looking at the source code of other websites and through other resources I found on the web. I quickly became a proponent of standards-based and semantic markup. I also have a BFA in Visual Communication (Graphic Design) from the University of Kansas where I developed my formal design and photography skills.</p>
		<p>Through freelancing I have gained additional skills and interests such as developing and customizing content management systems allowing me to be able to provide a full suite of services for my clients: branding and identity design, UI and web design, photography and full-stack web development.</p>
		<p>Most recently, I joined Educational Testing Service. Initially hired as an Interaction Designer, I later became the team lead of one of their student-facing software application teams, and finally took the role of managing the design team in charge of the UX of their suite of K-12 assessment products. At ETS I became more deeply involved with web-based application development and directed efforts in creating a modular, configurable, multi-tenant assessment application.</p>
		<p>As a UX lead, I managed a team charged with improving the User Experience across a range of assessment delivery, administration, and reporting applications. This included being the primary advocate of accessible front-end development, pushing for WCAG-compliant and screen-reader compatible software through all stages of the product cycle. I implemented new processes focused on data-driven design by gathering as much first-hand information about our users as possible. I also helped to focus the team on a design-driven approach to product development, incorporating design thinking in all phases of the software life-cycle from the gathering of business requirements to operations and support.
</p>
		<p>I am looking for further opportunities to work with people who are as passionate as I am about building high-quality products that delight users. I enjoy working on challenging problems with designers, engineers, product managers, and others. I always endeavor to learn and understand different points of view and believe that diverse viewpoints always make the process and product better.</p>
		<p>Below I have a selected a small number of items to provide a context of the range of work I have done over the years spanning UX Design, Web Design, Branding, Photography and more.</p>
