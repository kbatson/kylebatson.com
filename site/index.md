<p>I have been designing far before I knew it was an actual career. I enjoy understanding how systems work and learning how to make them better. I think about the <strong>big picture</strong>, but also know that the <strong>details</strong> are crucial to delight the user. I am <strong>passionate</strong> about the quality of the products I work on and my advocacy for the user.</p>
<p>Check out some examples of my work below. I'm always interested in connecting and learning how I can bring my creative and analytical skills to your organiztion.</p>
