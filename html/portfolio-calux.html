			<h3>User Experience Design and Strategy at CA&amp;L</h3>
			<p>As the lead for a newly formed User Experience team, I assisted the team and company through the creation of processes for product design that introduced UX and UI design at the beginning of the product development cycle. This involved bringing in more research to better understand users and their tasks. The team documented their research as user Personas and created Journey Maps to help create better understanding and empathy towards the users throughout the product team. The Journey Map creation process involved representatives from various departments (software development, analysis, business development, operations, support etc.) to help create ownership and buy-in for the results.</p>
			<p>These documents were then used to help guide the design and development of new features and improvements, keeping the users and their needs constantly in mind.</p>
			<p>The design system worked closely with the Business Analysis team to create User Workflows based on use cases. The designers then and built interactive wireframes and wrote detailed documentation to clearly communicate to the software development and quality assurance teams the proper behavior for the system.</p>
			<p>The focus on the User Experience went even deeper as we brought on board an accessibility specialist. We worked with them to revise the HTML and other behaviors to go even beyond WCAG compliance with standards-based markup to support screen readers and other use cases.</p>
